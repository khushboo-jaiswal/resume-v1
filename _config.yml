about_content: | 
  I am a dedicated and results-driven professional with a unique combination of experience in both customer resolution and pension administration. With a strong background in handling complex issues and providing timely solutions, I am passionate about ensuring customer satisfaction and operational efficiency.

  Currently, as a General Administrator at People's Partnership, I manage pension-related tasks, ensuring regulatory compliance, maintaining accurate records, and driving process enhancements. During my tenure at Amazon as a Resolution Specialist, I developed strong skills in managing high-pressure customer interactions and delivering exceptional service tailored to individual needs.

  Holding an MBA from Savitribai Phule Pune University and a bachelor’s degree from Bangalore University, I bring a strong academic foundation to my professional roles. My key strengths include exceptional communication, problem-solving abilities, and a commitment to continuous learning and improvement.
